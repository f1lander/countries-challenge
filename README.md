# Firstleaf Take Home Project

## Intro
Today, we're going to construct a country of the world app!  This assignment allows you to demonstrate your experience with ReactJS and CSS.

## Assignment
Given a data API located here: https://restcountries.eu/#api-endpoints-all.  Build an app in ReactJS that meets the requirements below.

## Requirements
- displays a list of the countries using a component CountryCard for display
- allows you to click the country card, and display the countries' profile ("region, capital city and population (and any other extra info you'd like to add)")
- allows you to search for a specific country by name

Use: https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/{name}  ({name being the country name}) for searching the name
Use: https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all to get all the countries

## Extra
- What does code quality look like to you? Show us with your code!  If you have an eye for design, impress us with your CSS powers!

## Let's Get Started:
1. Clone this repository 
2. If you don't have node installed download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/
3. Go to the root directory of the repository in your command line and run npm i or npm install
4. Run npm start, and it should load a basic rendered page in your default browser
5. You're ready to code!


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Steps

### `nvm use`
### `yarn && yarn start`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
